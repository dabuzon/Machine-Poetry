# Machine Poetry
Machine as human-reflecting is nothing new in the age of Web 2.0. With the unprecedented development of technologies such as machine learning, Twitter bots, and [Sophie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)), the reckoning of technology as a serious interface between automated super performers and humanity is something now of serious concern considering the wake of the 2016 US Presidential election. The question that always has to be asked is, what makes the digital so close to the analog?

***Machine Poetry*** is a reflection and summation of interests that have since developed during my time as an undergrad in the Design | Media Arts program at UCLA. Exploring intersections of language, technology, art, and culture, I return to the essence of my original interests (language and technology). ***Machine Poetry*** is the final statement and artistic expression of the two primary interests that consistently found itself in my work as a graphic artist: poetry and computers.
## Artwork details
***Machine Poetry*** was a mixed media artwork created by [Darin Buzon](https://darinbuzon.info/) and exhibited for the [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/) [Design | Media Arts](http://dma.ucla.edu/) Final Senior Exhibition *[Pressed for Space](http://dma.ucla.edu/pressed4space)*, from 6 June 2019 to 15 June 2019.

The hardware used included an OKI Microline 186 9-pin dot matrix printer, a Sony CRT monitor, a Raspberry Pi 4, and a 1995 IBM 71G4644 KEYBOARD.

Its source code was programmed in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and Java with significant contributions and assistance from [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/), the faculty advisor for the senior capstone focus in interactive media, [Ben Lerchin](http://benlerchin.com/) and [Hye Min Cho](https://hyeminchocho.com/), then graduate students in the department. Run on Linux, the artwork communicates its algorithms through [CUPS](https://www.cups.org/) to print the generated poems through the dot matrix printer and subsequent continuous paper.
## Repository details
This repository contains the source code for the [installation media](src/installation/), the [assets](assets/) used for the artwork's production, [documentation](documentation/) of the artwork itself, and the [research](research/) gathered during ideation including links and bibliography.

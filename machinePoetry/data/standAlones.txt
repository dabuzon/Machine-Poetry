Don't love 
I was in love and in pain 
I am going to be snubbed 
I am too often calling out to the void 
People take its mantle 
And so I wished for it all 
and that was my fault 
Today I ask for rice and spice 
It’s unfortunate but it is 
life is now too tragic to have 
to be human 
throw that out the window 
How do I take care of myself 
Contrast creates form. 
A shadow contextualizes an object. 
I am interested in objects. 
I’ve fallen real hard this time 
a breath of heavy air 
A smell, a taste; 
the human limestone, 
Is that who you are? 
To all who took care of me 
To all who I wish took care of me 
Today (10/27) is a beautiful day 
What is it even that we want 
text back some people 
All fingers except for engagement 
They’re not all there for you 
Go out and have some fun; 
Grad students are our friendz 
I’m enjoying myself 
go out on a date, 
Here now so I can do better 
I want to learn and teach too late 
A bunch of hurt 
I’m in outsider 
Of concern and care 
A rush of melancholy sweeps through 
I am revisited 
I want to feel so grateful 
It’s good to know people 
Is idolatry a sin? 
All I want are mentors 
In love? 
And with that, the word 
And with that, the truth 
And with that, reality 
And yes, no one 
No time to be denied 
Least deserving, most receiving 
Kinda bored 
Why am I full of tears 
No one may mistreat me! 
Will grad school save you? 
How do I take care of myself 
I had no control
